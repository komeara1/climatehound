ClimateHound Setup

Citation: https://learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/measuring-temperature-with-a-beaglebone-black.pdf

Prerequisites:
TMP36 sensor
5V power supply
Keyboard/mouse
Breadboard (1/2 or Full)
Male to Male jumpers
Ensure GPIO is installed
Python


Steps:
Connect your BeagleBone Black (BBB) to your keyboard/mouse, monitor, and power supply.

BBB should boot and login automatically.

Launch a Terminal from the Menu.

Check to see if Python IO BBIO Library is installed.
*On my BBB it was already installed.

Type 'python' to enter interactive Python. Type 'import Adafruit_BBIO.ADC as ADC'. If you do not get an error, Python IO BBIO Library is already installed. 

If you do get an error, go to https://learn.adafruit.com/setting-up-io-python-library-on-beaglebone-black and follow the instructions from the specific OS (Angstrom or Debian/Ubuntu) that is installed on your BBB.
*Debian was preinstalled on my BBB

Wiring the BBB:
See bbb_wiriing.tiff file in the directory for the solderless wiring setup from the BBB to the breadboard.

The flat side of the TMP36 sensor should be facing the BBB.

Blue wire connects from the GNDA_ADC to the GND pin of the TMP36 sensor -> the grounding connection

Red wire connects from pin 3 (3.3V) to the positive supply pin of TMP36 -> the power connection

Orange wire connects to P9.40 -> reads this the millivolts that is then convert to temperature (Fahrenheit or Celsius)

For more granular detail of ADC and why the wires go where they go - https://learn.adafruit.com/setting-up-io-python-library-on-beaglebone-black/adc

Using Python to interact with the BBB-TMP36 configuration. See the climatehound.py file in the directory.

Optional:
Install ssmtp on the BBB to send you the output from climatehound.py.
